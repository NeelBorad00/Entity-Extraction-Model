# Entity-Extraction-Model

This repository contains the **Entity Extraction Model**, developed as part of a hackathon challenge to extract entity values from images using machine learning techniques.  

## Features  
- **Data Handling**: Processes images and associated metadata for entity extraction tasks.  
- **Customizable ML Pipeline**: Includes preprocessing, model training, and evaluation scripts.  
- **Optimized Accuracy**: Designed to achieve high performance in extracting values from structured and unstructured data.  

## Requirements  
- Python 3.8 or later  
- Required Libraries:  
  ```bash  
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ## Ensure access to the following datasets:
- `train.csv`: Contains the image links, group IDs, entity names, and corresponding entity values for training the model.
- `test.csv`: Includes image links, group IDs, and entity names for evaluating the model's performance.
- `sample_test.csv`: A sample dataset for testing the model and verifying its predictions.
